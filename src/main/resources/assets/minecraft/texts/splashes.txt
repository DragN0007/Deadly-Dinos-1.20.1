Deadly Dinos 1.20.1 Beta!
I wish birds were real.
Why aren't carnivores nice?
If not friend, why friend shaped?
Some things have sharper teeth than others.
If you see a large turkey, run.
I think I peed myself
Carnotaurus is faster than it looks.
Pssh, we don't need electric fences.
If Rex was a little faster, it would be scarier than Acro!
Mahakala is the scariest dino. Stay away!
Rex can still see you if you’re standing still!
Spinosaurus lurks in the water. Don’t go swimming!
Is that a rock in the water? No, don’t jump on it. Trust me.
You aren’t safe behind your base walls.
Maybe hiding in caves isn’t the best idea?
Watch out for the Golden Tree.
The fog is coming. The fog is coming. The fog is coming.
Don't look behind you.
There's something standing in your doorway.
I'd lock the door if I were you.
Deinocherius is just as aggressive as Therizinosaurus. Sorry...
Don't be a dino-sore loser... Click the respawn button!
